# Practice 1: Breaking Down a Table into Components

## Objective

Create a React application that displays a table of "Student Grades" by breaking down the table into smaller, reusable components.  
Use an **array of objects** to represent the data and style the table using **Bootstrap**.

---

## Requirements

1. **Data Structure**: Use an array of objects to represent student data. Each object should contain:
   - `id`: A unique identifier for each student.
   - `name`: The name of the student.
   - `subject`: The subject theyâ€™re graded on.
   - `grade`: The grade they received.

   Example array:

   ```javascript
   const studentData = [
     { id: 1, name: "Alice", subject: "Math", grade: "A" },
     { id: 2, name: "Bob", subject: "Science", grade: "B" },
     { id: 3, name: "Charlie", subject: "History", grade: "A-" },
     { id: 4, name: "Diana", subject: "English", grade: "B+" },
     { id: 5, name: "Edward", subject: "Math", grade: "C" },
   ];
   ```
